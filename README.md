# Digital-Hourly-Raports (DONE)
Digitalization of paper forms to collect and analyze data about outputs and KPI values from line.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project was initiated in response to the need to move away from paper-based hourly reports, which were inefficient and required manual analysis by leaders to obtain key performance indicators (KPIs) such as units down, OEE, Pareto chart of time losses, or FPY.

The main stages of the project include:

1. Replacing traditional paper-based hourly reports with electronic ones, based on Excel spreadsheets.
2. Implementing these spreadsheets at workstations on the production line and coordinating the purchase and installation of MS Teams F3 licenses for efficient communication and document storage.
3. Creating a tool for automatic data collection and presenting it in a clear format for each leader.
4. Developing a tool for automatic visualization of all KPI indicators from different areas, facilitating the review of weekly summaries.
5. Conducting training for operators and leaders on how to use the new tools and work procedures.

The data structure includes generating hourly reports (units down, time losses, OEE, FPY), which are then aggregated into weekly reports for leaders (related to productivity, delivery efficiency) and ultimately into weekly reports for the entire factory.

The technologies used are:
- MS Teams as the main platform for storing and exchanging data.
- Excel for data collection, storage, and analysis, as well as for creating electronic spreadsheets.
- VBA for creating scripts to automate certain tasks, such as updating pivot tables.
- Power BI for data visualization based on databases of hourly reports and leader reports.
